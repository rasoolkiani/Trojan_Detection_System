Trojan_Detection_System

This is a project for Detecting Hardware Trijans with javaFX and VHDL code.

In the VHDL code we recognize trojans in hardware fpga core and with serial ports send a message to javafx interpreter for showing a proper message to user.

For this purpose you should install ISE Xilinx and JDK and JRE and use it.
Additionally we compress ISE Xilinx projects in .RAR file.

Any Contribution will be Appreciated.
